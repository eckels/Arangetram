    <p class="header">Dear Guest,</p>

    <p>If you’re seeing this, it means that I invited you to come to my Arangetram this summer! At this point you’re probably wondering, what even is this? And most importantly, why should you go? I am here to answer these questions for you.</p>

    <p>Let’s start with the what; what will this arangetram entail? I will be dancing, solo, to a live indian orchestra for a grand total of about 2 hours. Simply stated, You’ll see me dance my heart out while dolled up a traditional and extravagant costume, trying my best to breathe.</p>

    <p>Now, for the why? Why should you come? Why should you take time out of your life, that too a Saturday from summer, to watch me dance? I can give you three reasons.<p>

    <p>First - my Arangetram will something completely different than anything you’ve seen before. For those of you who go to Arangetrams often, this Arangetram will be different than any other. My teacher and I are putting a different spin on it, and throwing in a few surprises to keep it interesting. If you’ve never been to an Arangetram before, then I’m sure you’ve never seen anything like it, which is all the more reason to come!</p>

    <p>Second - If you enjoy music or dance. Musicians, dancers, and people who just like music or dance or general, you should come! At an Arangetram, you will not only get to see me dance, but you’ll get to hear an incredibly unique and mesmerizing style of music, performed live.</p>

    <p>Last but not least - You should come to support me. I’ve been preparing for this for weeks and months, working harder than I ever have before. You were invited because you mean something to me, and you’ve made an impact on my life in some way, and I want you to be there for one of the biggest days of my life.</p>

    <p>I hope after reading this, you’ve decided to come! Please take a few minutes to click on the button below and fill the reservation form out, just to help my mom and I with the planning. I look forward to seeing you there :-)</p>
