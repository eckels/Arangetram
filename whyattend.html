      <p>If you’re seeing this, it means that you are invited to come to my Arangetram on July 28th! At this point you’re probably wondering, what even is this? And most importantly, why should you come? I am here to answer these questions for you.</p>

      <p>Let’s start with the what; what will this arangetram (Pronounced uh-rung-gate-rum in case you weren’t sure) entail? If you come, which I sincerely hope you do, you will see me dance my heart out while wearing a traditional and extravagant costume. I will be performing solo, to a live Indian orchestra for a grand total of about 2 hours.</p>

      <p>Now, for the why? Why should you come? Why should you take time out of your life, that too a Saturday from summer, to watch me dance? I can give you three reasons.</p>

      <p>First, my Arangetram will be something completely different than anything you may have seen before. For those of you who go to Arangetrams often, mine will not be a cookie-cutter Arangetram. The songs and choreography is unique: my teacher and I are putting a different spin on it, and throwing in a few surprises to make it interesting. If you’ve never been to an Arangetram before, then I’m sure you’ve never seen anything like it, which is all the more reason to come.</p>

      <p>Second, if you enjoy music or dance. As a dancer myself, I love watching others perform, and I hope that all dancers out there want to see me too! To all the musicians out there, you will not only get to see me dance, but you’ll get to hear an incredibly unique and mesmerizing style of music, performed live.</p>

      <p>Last but not least, you should come to support me, and to support my wonderful mother. I’ve been preparing for this for weeks and months, working harder than I ever have before, practicing multiple hours everyday. My mother has been right behind me, not only in planning this Arangetram and putting it together, but by supporting me when I’m hungry and tired and sore. We invited you because you mean something to one or both of us, and you’ve made an impact on our lives in some way. We want you to be there for one of the biggest days of our lives.</p>

      <p>In case you still need an enticement, I can tell you that if you come, you’ll get a free dinner as well! And lucky for you, the dinner will be made by an excellent chef; trust me on this one.</p>

      <p>I hope after reading this, you’ve decided to come! Please take a few minutes to fill this out, just to help my mom and I with the planning. I look forward to seeing you there :-)</p>
